Also, that “99 Little Bugs” song? Yeah, it’s basically my life soundtrack.  

I occasionally lurk on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankita-dey-8a652b1ba) — mostly watching others post impressive stuff while I debate what snack to eat.

### Current arsenal:  

- Python & Django (the golden twins I spoil the most)  
- C (my first love, but... we kinda grew apart)  
- Java (the ex I occasionally stalk but never text)  
- HTML & CSS (the boring relatives — necessary, but let’s not chat too long)
